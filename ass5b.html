                <p><br><i><u><b>The History of the Book of Enoch</b></u></i></p>
                <br>The History of the Book of Enoch The book was thought to have been lost, for over 2,000 years, with many
                ancient sources referring to it, and even quoting parts, but no complete copies were known. Then in 1773,
                James Bruce brought three copies back from Ethiopia, having spent some years exploring the country. Enoch
                had two main reasons for writing his book. The first was because the Watchers instructed him to do it, (see
                section 15 at 81.5 and 81.6). The second reason; was to save his family from the flood. Enoch wrote his book,
                after his grandson Lamech was born, but before Noah was born. Noah is only named in the section that Methuselah
                wrote, (see section 10 at 107.3), and of course in his own section (section 11, The Book of Noah). So, there
                may still have been 40 - 80 years left before the flood, at the time when Enoch wrote his book. There is
                a long gap between the time of the flood and the time when Moses gave praise to Enoch in Genesis. Genesis
                dates from around 1400 BC, and forms part of the Torah (the first five books of the bible). In Genesis, there
                is Enoch's family; as named by him in this book, and a quick recap of some of Enoch's story. It seems likely
                therefore, that copies of the Book of Enoch survived into Egyptian times, 3500 BC, and was known to Moses
                around 2,000 years later.
                Moses presumably took a copy of the book with him when they all left Egypt, and
                he was no doubt pleased to see Enoch's prophecy fulfilled. The book probably existed mainly in Hebrew during
                the thousand years after the exodus. No Hebrew copies exist today, however, although there are some Hebrew
                passages quoted in some of the Aramaic fragments that survive from a few centuries BC. The appearance of
                the book in Ethiopia, is probably due to events in   4 Jerusalem during the reign of King
                Manasseh of Judah, (695 - 642 BC), which are documented in the Bible, (2Chronicles 33:1 - 20, and at 2Kings
                21:1 – 18). King Manasseh was not of the Jewish faith, he erected alters to Baal and Asherah in Solomon's
                Temple. In Kings at 21:16, it says that so much innocent blood was shed that it filled Jerusalem from end
                to end. At this time, the religious establishment left the country, taking the Ark of the Covenant and all
                the important religious texts with them. After a number of years in Egypt, the refugees went further south,
                near to the source of the Nile, at Lake Tana in Ethiopia. The descendants of these people are the Falashas,
                who even today follow the form of Judaism that had been practiced in Israel only before 620 BC. The Ethiopians
                translated The Book of Hanokh into Ge'ez, and had enough respect to look after it. Meanwhile, all Hebrew
                versions disappeared but a substantial part of the book had survived in Greek. The two commonly available
                translations were done soon after this and the book was received with an embarrassed silence, for the most
                part, and not widely read. This book is based on a new translation published in 1978, which was produced
                as a result of research into a large number of the Ethiopian manuscripts and a review of all other surviving
                fragments. My hope is that this present edition will be the best version of Enoch's book available in English.
                I think this is an important book, and I have done my best to present it as clearly as possible, and in a
                way that I hope Hanokh would have approved of.

                <br><p><i><u>Chapter Content</u></i></p>

                Chapter Content Within each chapter, many topics have been added or expanded to address the current issues managers face.
                At the same time, chapter text has been tightened and sharpened to provide greater focus on the key topics that count for
                management today. This tightening has resulted in a shortening of the text from 21 to 19 chapters. The essential elements
                about operations and technology have been combined into one chapter. An appendix on entrepreneurship and small business has
                been provided for students who want more information on managing in small businesses start-ups.
                
                <br><b><a name="Chapter_1">Chapter 1</a></b>
                <br><p><i><u>Chapter 1</u></i></p>

                Chapter 1 includes a section on making the leap from being an individual contributor in the organization to becoming a new manager and getting work done
                primarily through others. The chapter introduces the skills and competencies needed to manage organizations effectively,
                including issues such as managing diversity, coping with globalization, and managing crises. In addition, the chapter discusses
                today’s emphasis within organizations on innovation as a response to a rapidly changing environment.
                
                <br><b><a name="Chapter_2">Chapter 2</a></b>
                <br><p><i><u>Chapter 2</u></i></p>

                Chapter 2 continues  its solid coverage of the historical development of management and organizations. It also examines new management thinking
                for turbulent times. The chapter includes a new section on systemic thinking and an expanded discussion of post-World War
                II management techniques. The fi nal part of the chapter looks at issues of managing the technology-driven workplace, including
                supply chain management, customer relationship management, and outsourcing.
                
                <br><b><a name="Chapter_3">Chapter 3</a></b>
                <br><p><i><u>Chapter 3</u></i></p>

                Chapter 3 contains an updated look at current issues related to the environment and corporate culture, including a new section on issues related to the natural environment
                and managers’ response to environmental advocates. The chapter also illustrates how managers shape a high–performance culture
                as an innovative response to a shifting environment.
                
                <br><b><a name="Chapter_4">Chapter 4</a></b>
                <br><p><u><i>Chapter 4</i></u></p>

                Chapter 4 takes a look at the growing power of China and India in today’s global business environment and what this means
                for managers around the world. The chapter discusses the need for cultural intelligence, and a new section looks at understanding
                communication differences as an important aspect of learning to manage internationally or work with people from different
                cultures. In addition, the complex issues surrounding globalization are discussed, including a consideration of the current
                globalization backlash. A new section on human resources points out the need for evaluating whether people are suitable for
                foreign assignments.
                
                <br><b><a name="Chapter_5">Chapter 5</a></b>
                <br><p><u><i>Chapter 5</i></u></p>

                Chapter 5 makes the business case for incorporating ethical values in the organization. The chapter includes a new discussion of the bottom-of-the-pyramid business concept and how managers are successfully applying this new
                thinking. The chapter also has an expanded discussion of ethical challenges managers face today, including responses to recent
                fi nancial scandals. It considers global ethical issues, as well, including a discussion of corruption rankings of various
                countries.

                <br><p><u><i>Chapter 6</i></u></p>

                Chapter 6 provides a more focused discussion of the overall planning process and a new discussion of using strategy
                maps for aligning goals. This chapter also takes a close look at crisis planning and how to use scenarios. The chapter’s
                fi nal section on planning for high performance has been enhanced by a new discussion of intelligence teams and an expanded
                look at using performance dashboards to help managers plan in a fast-changing environment.
