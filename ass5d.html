                        <br><u><b>The Great Apostasy</b></u>
                        <p><br>18The Apostasy Predicted 181. In proceeding with our present inquiry we accept as demonstrated facts the establishment of
                        the Church of Christ under the Savior's personal administration and the rapid growth of the Church in the early period of
                        the apostolic ministry. 182. A question of the utmost importance is: Has the Church of Christ, thus authoritatively established,
                        maintained an organized existence upon the earth from the apostolic age to the present? Other questions are suggested by
                        the first. If the Church has continued as an earthly organization, where lies the proof or evidence of legitimate succession
                        in priestly authority, and which among the multitude of contending sects or churches of the present day is the actual possessor
                        of the holy priesthood originally committed to the Church by the Christ, its founder? 183. Again, have the spiritual gifts
                        and graces by which the early Church was characterized and distinguished been manifest on earth through the centuries that
                        have passed since the meridian of time; and if so, in which of the numerous churches of these modern times do we find such
                        signs following the professed believers? fn 18 - 194. We affirm that with the passing of the so-called apostolic age the
                        Church gradually drifted into a condition of apostasy, whereby succession in the priesthood was broken; and that the Church,
                        as an earthly organization operating under divine direction and having authority to officiate in spiritual ordinances, ceased
                        to exist. 195. If therefore the Church of Christ is to be found upon the earth today it must have been re-established by
                        divine authority; and the holy priesthood must have been restored to the world from which it was lost by the apostasy of
                        the Primitive Church. fn 196. We affirm that the great apostasy was foretold by the Savior Himself while He lived as a Man
                        among men, and by His inspired prophets both before and after the period of His earthly probation. And further, we affirm
                        that a rational interpretation of history demonstrates the fact of this great and general apostasy. 197. Before we take up
                        in detail the specific predictions referred to, and the evidence of their dread fulfilment, we may profitably devote brief
                        attention to certain general considerations. 19 - 208. Respecting the foreknowledge of God, let it not be said that divine
                        omniscience is of itself a determining cause whereby events are inevitably brought to pass. A mortal father who knows the
                        weaknesses and frailties of his son may by reason of that knowledge sorrowfully predict the calamities and sufferings awaiting
                        his wayward boy. He may foresee in that son's future a forfeiture of blessings that could have been won, loss of position,
                        self-respect, reputation and honor; even the dark shadows of a felon's cell and the night of a drunkard's grave may appear
                        in the saddening visions of that fond father's soul; yet, convinced by experience of the impossibility of bringing about
                        that son's reform, he foresees the dread developments of the future, and he finds but sorrow and anguish in his knowledge.
                        Can it be said that the father's foreknowledge is a cause of the son's sinful life? The son, perchance, has reached his maturity;
                        he is the master of his own destiny; a free agent unto himself. The father is powerless to control by force or to direct
                        by arbitrary command; and, while he would gladly make any effort or sacrifice to save his son from the fate impending, he
                        fears for what seems to be an awful certainty. But surely that thoughtful, prayerful, loving parent does not contribute to
                        the son's waywardness because of his knowledge. To reason otherwise would be to say that a neglectful father, who takes not
                        the trouble to study the nature and character of his son, who shuts his eyes to sinful tendencies, and rests in careless
                        indifference as to the probable future, will by his very heartlessness be benefitting his child, because his lack of forethought
                        cannot operate as a contributory cause to dereliction. 209. Our Heavenly Father has a full knowledge of the nature and dispositionsof each of His children, a knowledge gained by long observation and experience in the past eternity of our primeval childhood;
                        a knowledge compared with which that gained by earthly parents through mortal experience with their children is infinitesimally
                        small. By reason of that surpassing knowledge, God reads the future of child and children, of men individually and of men
                        collectively as communities and nations; He knows what each will do under given conditions, and sees the end from the beginning.
                        His foreknowledge is based on intelligence and reason; He foresees the future as a state which naturally and surely will
                        be; not as one which must be because He has arbitrarily willed that it shall be. 20 - 2110. But, it may be argued that in
                        the illustrative instance given above—that of the earthly parent and the wayward son,—the father had not the power to change
                        the sad course of sin whereby his son is hastening to ignominy and destruction; while the omnipotent Father can save if He
                        will. In reply this is to be said: The Father of souls has endowed His children with the divine birth-right of free agency;
                        He does not and will not control them by arbitrary force; He impels no man toward sin; He compels none to righteousness.
                        Unto man has been given freedom to act for himself; and, associated with this independence, is the fact of strict responsibility
                        and the assurance of individual accountability. In the judgment with which we shall be judged, all the conditions and circumstances of our lives shall be considered.

                        The inborn tendencies due to heredity, the effect of environment whether conducive to good
                        or evil, the wholesome teachings of youth, or the absence of good instruction—these and all other contributory elements must
                        be taken into account in the rendering of a just verdict as to the soul's guilt or innocence. Nevertheless, the divine wisdom
                        makes plain what will be the result with given conditions operating on known natures and dispositions of men; while every
                        individual is free to choose good or evil within the limits of the many conditions existing and operative. fn 21 - 2211.
                        Another matter worthy of thought in the present connection is this: Is the fact of the great apostasy,—the virtual overthrow
                        and destruction of the Church established by Jesus Christ,—to be regarded as an instance of failure in the Lord's plans?
                        Is it a case of defeat in which Satan was victor over Christ? Consider the following. What mortal has yet measured the standard
                        by which Omniscience gages success or failure? Who dares affirm that what man hails as triumph or deplores as defeat will
                        be so accounted when tested by the principles of eternal reckoning? 2212. The history of the world abounds with instances
                        of the temporary triumph of evil, of justice seemingly miscarried, of divine plans for the time being frustrated, of God's
                        purposes opposed and their consummation delayed. 2213. We read of the Lord's covenant with Israel. Unto Abraham, Isaac, and
                        Jacob He declared that their descendants should be a people chosen for His special service among the nations. Through that
                        lineage the Savior of mankind was to be born; in the posterity of Abraham all nations of the earth were to be blessed. Blessings
                        beyond the heart of man to conceive, beyond the mind of man to comprehend, were promised on condition of loyal allegiance
                        to Him who proclaimed Himself their God and their King. Moreover the Lord predicted calamity and suffering, individual affliction
                        and national disgrace, if Israel departed from the service of Jehovah and yielded to the enticements of their heathen neighbors
                        who knew not God. Think you that the Lord was ignorant of the course His people would choose? Did He fail to foresee that
                        Israel would follow the evil way, forfeiting the blessings and reaping the harvest of sorrow? Jehovah's plans failed not,
                        though the realization of the blessings so abundantly promised has been long delayed. Equally forceful with the prediction
                        of calamity in case of sin, was the promise of eventual restoration to favor. The dispersion of Israel already accomplished,
                        was to be followed by the gathering of Israel now in progress.</p>
