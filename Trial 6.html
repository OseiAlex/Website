	 <b><a href ="Manasseh"></a>A MARVELOUS WORK AND A WONDER</b></p> 
	 The Lord spared Noah and his family from the judgment of the flood. 
	 And He delivered Lot and his family just before His wrath fell on Sodom and Gomorrah. After the same pattern,
	 <br>God warned a small group of Israelites to flee out of Jerusalem just before the Babylonian captivity in 600 B.C.
     Then He directed them to build a ship like Noah built the Ark, and they miraculously sailed to America.
     They were of the Tribe of Joseph and they took a copy the O.T. Scriptures
     Just as God raised up many prophets in Jerusalem to prophesy of the coming Messiah, God also raised up prophets
    among this remnant or “Lost” tribe of Israelites. They also preached righteousness and prophesied many wonderful things about
    the coming Redeemer, Jesus Christ. This amazing history in America between 600 B.C. - 421 A.D. was written on metal plates.

	The last prophet among them buried the ancient inspired records in the ground. The Native Americans are the descendents of
    this remnant of the Tribe of Joseph, through Manasseh. In about 1830 the metal records were discovered, translated, and printed
    as THE BOOK OF MORMON. Sadly, the translator, Joseph Smith, Jr., later fell into polygamy and many serious false doctrines.
    But we should not throw out the Book of Mormon because of human failure. For instance, we do not throw out the Book of Psalms
    because David later committed adultery and tried to cover it up with murder. And we do not throw out the Book of Proverbs
    even though Solomon had too many wives and built temples unto false gods. And remember, Joseph Smith did not even write the
    Book of Mormon ---he just translated it. Jesus mentioned these Israelites in ancient America in John 10:16, saying, “And
    other sheep I have, which are not of this fold: them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be
    one fold, and one Shepherd.”
	
	Most folks assume Jesus was referring to the Gentiles, but notice that Jesus said these sheep
    outside the Jerusalem fold would literally “hear my voice” Jesus also said, “I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the
    house of Israel.” Mt. 15:24 So Jesus never personally preached to the Gentiles, only to Israelites. But after Christ was
    crucified, arose, and ascended unto Heaven off Mt. Olivet, He came around to this side of the world and personally appeared
    to these lost sheep of the House of Israel and they heard Him preached unto them! This precious book is a gold mine of truth
    and serves to confirm everything in our Holy Bible. If you are not through learning and you hunger and thirst for more of
    the life-giving Word of God, then just let me know and I will send you a copy of this Nephite Record, FREE and postage paid.
