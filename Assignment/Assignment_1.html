        <p><center><u><b><h1>FEAR</h1></b></u></center></p><hr>
        <p>The hurt in my eyes is all that has to be said<br>
            I know I'm <i>better</i> off dead<br>
            The pain is the only thing I can feel<br>
            Knowing it's the one thing that's real<br>
            Behind all the games and lies<br>
            An <em>emptiness</em> haunts my eyes<br>
            A person who I used to be<br>
            Worse even though it wasn't me<br>
            Sorrow <sub>consuming</sub> every thought<br>
            Slowly losing <i>everything</i><br>
            I've got Darkness closing in all around<br>
            Still I don't make a single sound<br>
            Evil fills the void inside<br>
            This life's not one<br>
            I'll confide <u>However</u> deeper someone tries to look<br>
            Whatever happens the <i>ground</i> has shook<br>
            The dread and hate leaves me in a daze<br>
            All around me demons fires blaze<br>
            Living isn't worthwhile if its torture<br>
            Yet it's that to which I'm not sure<br>
            Don't try to <small>understand</small> the words written here<br>
            For I'm not the one to fear!

        <div><p><center><u><b><h1>TRUTH</h1></b></u></center></p><hr>
        <p>
             My pain and misery fall from the sky<br>
             So hard I try to ignore it, but it still gets by.<br>
             Surrounded with memories of what could have been,<br>
             The hatred screams under my skin.<br>
             Pulsing through my veins is the anger I feel.<br>
             Wounds break open as soon as they seal.<br>
             Darkness <sup>surrounds</sup> me with every step I take.<br>
             I manage a smile, but do you know it's a fake?<br>
             I laugh when people talk to me,<br>
             But inside I'm dying, <b>wishing</b> they could see<br>
             I'm as different inside as I am the same.<br>
             Wish they could see they're not to <big>blame</big><br>
             <pre>I know the truth, but it's locked in my heart,</pre><br>
             And now more than ever, it's tearing me apart.<br>
            </p></div>
