                <br>THE MIRACLE OF FORGIVENESS Spencer W. Kimball © 1969 by Bookcraft, Inc. About this Book In his earthly ministry, Jesus performed
                many miracles. In particular he healed numerous diseased and disabled bodies. But perhaps his greatest miracle was the healing
                of people's souls— the forgiveness of sins. Jesus still offers that miracle today, and on the same terms as formerly— sincere
                repentance. In The Miracle of Forgiveness one of the Savior's modern apostles, Elder Spencer W. Kimball, draws on his rich
                experience and the inspiration of his calling to give a penetrating explanation of repentance and forgiveness and to clarify
                their implications for Church members. Summoning many enlightening experiences and allusions to aid his in-depth approach,
                he shows that the need for forgiveness is universal; portrays the various facets of repentance; outlines acts an attitudes
                which lead to wrongdoing; spells out sins not always recognized as such, especially by young offenders; and emphasizes some
                of the more serious errors, particularly sexual ones, which afflict modern society and even some Church members. Most important,
                he illuminates his message with the brightness of hope as he shows that most sins are forgivable when repentance is adequate,
                and that even those who have gone grievously astray may find the way back to peace and security. Perhaps never before has
                any book brought this vital and moving subject into so sharp a focus and expounded it with such authority and insight. This
                unique combination makes the book a major work of substance and power, one which will be read and appreciated by Church leaders,
                by parents, by youth— in fact by all perceptive members of the Church. This churchwide appeal is eminently fitting, for who
                does not need to improve his life? Who does not need the miracle of forgiveness? About the Author Few men possess the author's
                qualifications to write this book. Born in Salt Lake City in 1895, Elder Kimball was raised in Arizona by staunch Latter-day
                Saint parents and educated there at the public schools, the former Gila Academy, and the University of Arizona. To his early
                farming experience he added a business career in banking, insurance and real estate. His long and varied experience in public
                service embraces official positions in scouting, education, government, Chamber of Commerce, and Rotary Club. In 1969 Brigham
                Young University awarded him an honorary degree of Doctor of Laws. Family and Church have been the dedications of his life.
                In 1918, not long after completing a mission to the Central States, he married Camilla Eyring in the Salt Lake Temple, and
                their four children have given them 27 grandchildren. Having served successively as stake clerk, counselor in a stake presidency,
                and stake president, Elder Kimball was called to be an apostle in 1943. Since then he has been tireless in his efforts for
                youth development, Indian affairs, and missionary service, and has traveled extensively in visiting Church congregations
                around the world. One of Elder Kimball's assignments is to work closely with Church members who need help to reshape their
                personal lives. In this position he has had a rare opportunity to observe the causes and effects of wrongdoing, to display
                that proper balance of firmness and compassion for which he is known, and to encourage the wayward back onto the road of
                repentance. That opportunity, combined with his natural gifts and the wisdom born of his broad experience, makes him eminently
                well equipped to write The Miracle of Forgiveness. Preface And God wrought special miracles— (Acts 19:11.) Our Lord, Jesus
                Christ, is that God of miracles. On one occasion, he said to the Jewish believers: "And ye shall know the truth, and the
                truth shall make you free." (John 8:32.) Can any miracle compare with that one which is provided by Jesus? "... to loose
                the bands of wickedness, to undo the heavy burdens, and to let the oppressed go free ..." (Isa. 58:6.) He healed the sick,
                cast out devils, calmed the storm and even raised the dead. But can any miracle be equal to that one which frees men from
                the fetters of ignorance, superstition, and transgression? The Prophet Joseph Smith said: "It is better to save a man than
                raise one from the dead." Paul said: "O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory? The sting of death is sin
                ." (1 Cor. 15:55-56.) And this prompts the statement, "There is no tragedy except in sin." This book is not presented to
                entertain, but rather it has the serious purpose of presenting scriptures, experiences and exhortations with the hope that
                thereby many will be enticed to repent of their sins and indiscretions and set out to purify and perfect their lives. This
                design arose from my years of ministry as a stake president and as an apostle, during which time I have had many experiences
                in dealing with transgressors, especially those involved in sexual sins, both inside and outside of marriage. The scriptures
                being the firm basis of law and happiness, I have constantly felt the need of a selection of them which I could recommend
                to the offenders. My jottings of references grew into a collection from which this book has evolved. Because men and women
                are human and normally carnally minded, and because to do evil is usually easier than to do right, and because "all have
                sinned and come short of the glory of God," perhaps I have quoted far more scriptures on this subject of sexual sin than
                on any other. To cure spiritual diseases which throttle us and plague our lives, the Lord has given us a sure cure-repentance.
                I had made up my mind that I would never write a book and was even more determined when I read Job's warning: "Oh ... that
                mine adversary had written a book." (Job 31:35.) Three main reasons changed my mind. First, the need. When I come in contact
                almost daily with broken homes, delinquent children, corrupt governments, and apostate groups, and realize that all these
                problems are the result of sin, I want to shout with Alma: "O ... that I might go forth ... with a voice to shake the earth,
                and cry repentance unto every people." (Al. 29:1.) Hence this book indicates the seriousness of breaking God's commandments;
                shows that sin can bring only sorrow, remorse, disappointment, and anguish; and warns that the small indiscretions evolve
                into larger ones and finally into major transgressions which bring heavy penalties. Because of the prevalence and gravity
                of sexual and other major sins, these receive particular emphasis. Warning signals and guidelines are given to reduce the
                danger of one's being blindly enticed into forbidden paths. Having come to recognize their deep sin, many have tended to
                surrender hope, not having a clear knowledge of the scriptures and of the redeeming power of Christ. Second, then, I write
                to make the joyous affirmation that man can be literally transformed by his own repentance and by God's gift of forgiveness
                which follows for all except unpardonable sins. It is far better not to have committed the sin; the way of the transgressor
                is hard; but recovery is possible. Third, those of us whom the Lord has called to leadership have an inescapable responsibility,
                like that of Jacob and Joseph, to —[take] upon us the responsibility, answering the sins of the people upon our own heads
                if we did not teach them the word of God with all diligence; wherefore, by laboring with our might their blood might not
                come upon our garments—. (Jac. 1:19.) Isaiah warns: "Cry aloud, spare not, lift up thy voice like a trumpet, and shew my
                people their transgression, and the house of Jacob their sins." (Isa. 58:1.) Ezekiel sounds the warning to leaders: "...
                Should not the shepherds feed the flocks?" (Ezek. 34:2.) And then: "... If [the watchman] blow the trumpet, and warn the
                people ... whosoever ... taketh not warning his blood shall be upon his own head." (Ezek. 33:3-4.) The trumpet is to sound
                "... nothing but repentance unto this generation." (D&C 6:9.) Thus the message is to all the world, not only to members of
                the true Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. These reasons, and the predominance given to the subject in the appeals
                of every prophet and spiritual leader from Adam onwards, seem to me to justify a book dealing exclusively with sin, repentance
                and forgiveness. This is so despite the fact that many Church writers have included the subject as part of a more comprehensive
                work. In writing this book, I make no claim to originality or to literary genius. There may be nothing new or arresting here.
                On the other hand, I have deliberately repeated some scriptures to support varying facets of the subject or to insure a proper
                emphasis in the hope that those frustrated and in sin may wash "their robes in the blood of the Lamb," so that peace may
                settle down on them as the dews of heaven. Likewise, in writing about sin and repentance, no intent is implied that either
                the writer or any of those quoted, except the Lord himself, is without fault. But we would not have much motivation to righteousness if all speakers and writers postponed discussing and warning until they themselves were perfected!

                In Jacob's words: "...
                I know that the words of truth are hard against all uncleanness; but the righteous fear them not, for they love the truth
                and are not shaken." (2 Ne. 9:40.) Perhaps some of the same feelings come to us all as came to Peter as he approached the
                end of his life: Yea, I think it meet, as long as I am in this tabernacle, to stir you up by putting you in remembrance;
                Knowing that shortly I must put off this my tabernacle, even as our Lord Jesus Christ hath shewed me. Moreover I will endeavour
                that ye may be able after my decease to have these things always in remembrance. (2 Pet. 1:13-15.) I accept full responsibility
                for the contents of this book. Specifically, the Church and its leaders are totally absolved from the responsibility for
                any error which it may be found to contain. It is impossible for me or any other mortal to save another's soul, but it is
                my humble hope that through this book some who are suffering the baleful effects of sin may be helped to find the way from
                darkness to light, from suffering to peace, from misery to hope, and from spiritual death to eternal life. If to any degree
                the book achieves this, and helps to confirm others in a life of righteous endeavor, my efforts in its production will have
                been justified. Spencer W. Kimball ixChapter One ixThis Life Is the Time —For all contracts that are not made unto this end
                have an end when men are dead. —Doctrine & Covenants 132:7 For behold, this life is the time for men to prepare to meet God—
                —Alma 34:32 It is the destiny of the spirits of men to come to this earth and travel a journey of indeterminate length. They
                travel sometimes dangerously, sometimes safely, sometimes sadly, sometimes happily. Always the road is marked by divine purpose.
                The journey leads through infancy with its carefree activities but rapid learning; through childhood with its little disappointments
                and stubbed toes, its injured feelings, its keen excitements; through youth with its exuberance, its likes and dislikes,
                its fears and hopes and intensities; through the young married period with its responsibilities, its competitions, its ambitions,
                its family-rearing, its accumulating; and through older age with its achievements, culminations, goal-reaching, relaxation
                and retirement. Throughout the entire journey there is opportunity for learning and growth and development toward the final
                goal. We see some people who merely travel, having no aim, direction, destination or purpose. Without road maps to guide
                them, they just travel along the way and in varying degrees pick up such things as will please the eye, tickle the vanities,
                satisfy hungers, quench thirsts, satisfy passions. And when the end of life draws nigh they have traveled but are little
                if any closer to their proper destination than when they started. Regrettably, some have totally lost their way. Life's Divine
                Purpose On the other hand, there are some who chart their courses, make wise, right decisions, and in large measure achieve
                their goals and reach their happy destinations. In doing this they are cooperating with the Creator in his stated purpose
                of life: "For behold, this is my work and my glory-to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man." (Moses 1:39.)
                Since immortality and eternal life constitute the sole purpose of life, all other interests and activities are but incidental
                thereto. And since those objectives are the work and glory of God, they are the proper work of man also and are the major
                reason for his coming to earth. Of the two elements, the one great blessing-immortality-comes to man without his effort,
                as a gift from the Almighty. The other-eternal life-is a cooperative program to be developed by the Lord and his offspring
                on earth. It thus becomes the overall responsibility of man to cooperate fully with the Eternal God in accomplishing this
                objective. To this end God created man to live in mortality and endowed him with the potential to perpetuate the race, to
                subdue the earth, to perfect himself and to become as God, omniscient and omnipotent. Our Father then sent to the earth a
                line of prophets to keep man in remembrance of his duties and his destiny, to warn him of dangers, and to point the way to
                his total victory. It appears that the spiritual perceptions of many peoples have been inadequate to a full understanding
                of God's purposes, and he has accordingly had them taught at lower levels. This is apparently what Alma meant when he said:
                For behold, the Lord doth grant unto all nations, of their own nation and tongue, to teach his word, yea, in wisdom, all
                that he seeth fit that they should have... (Al. 29:8.) Unfortunately, God's people have too often rejected his way, to their
                own destruction. But the Lord has never permitted such people to be destroyed, nor permitted them to fail to reach their
                goal, without having taught them and warned them. For example, of the Jews it is recorded: "... and never hath any of them
                been destroyed save it were foretold them by the prophets of the Lord." (2 Ne. 25:9.) The scriptures point clearly to the
                high purpose of man's existence. Abraham and Moses particularly were explicit on this matter, as is revealed by records made
                available to us through the modern Prophet Joseph Smith. That Prophet, having learned the drama and purpose of it all from
                the ancient records as well as from heavenly visitations, continued to receive through direct revelation further light and
                truth respecting man's great potential. Through him God has abundantly confirmed that man is the supreme creation, made in
                the image and similitude of God and his Son, Jesus Christ; that man is the offspring of God; that for man, and man alone,
                was the earth created, organized, planted and made ready for human habitation; and that, having within him the seeds of godhood
                and thus being a god in embryo, man has unlimited potential for progress and attainment. Significance of Belief in God This
                book presupposes a belief in God and in life's high purpose. Without God, repentance would have little meaning, and forgiveness
                would be both unnecessary and unreal. If there were no God, life would indeed be meaningless; and as with the antediluvians,
                the Babylonians, the Israelites and numerous other peoples and civilizations, we might find justification in an urge to live
                only for today, to "eat, drink and be merry," to dissipate, to satisfy every worldly desire. If there were no God there would
                be no redemption, no resurrection, no eternities to anticipate, and consequently no hope. But there is a God, and he is loving,
                kind, just and merciful. There is a never-ending existence. Man will suffer or enjoy his future according to his life's works
                in mortality. Consequently, since mortal life is but a speck compared to the infinite duration of eternity, man should take
                great care that his present insures him joy and development and happiness for his eternal future. Our Pre-mortal Understanding
                In the record of an outstanding vision, Abraham amplified for us the purposes of God in creating the world and placing us
                upon it. Now the Lord had shown unto me, Abraham, the intelligences that were organized before the world was; and among all
                these there were many of the noble and great ones. (Abraham 3:22.) In the council in heaven, the Lord clearly outlined the
                plan and its conditions and benefits. The earth was to be not only a place of residence for man but also a school and a testing-ground,
                an opportunity for man to prove himself. Agency would be given man so that he could make his own choices. Life was to be
                in three segments or estates: pre-mortal, mortal, and immortal. The third stage would incorporate exaltation-eternal life
                with godhood-for those who would fully magnify their mortal lives. Performance in one estate would vitally affect the succeeding
                estate or estates. If a person kept his first estate, he would be permitted the second or the mortal life as a further period
                of trial and experience. If he magnified his second estate, his earth experience, eternal life would await him. To that end
                men go through the numerous experiences of earth life-"to see if they will do all things whatsoever the Lord their God shall
                command them." (Abraham 3:25.) We mortals who now live upon this earth are in our second estate. Our very presence here in
                mortal bodies attests the fact that we "kept" our first estate. Our spirit matter was eternal and co-existent with God, but
                it was organized into spirit bodies by our Heavenly Father. Our spirit bodies went through a long period of growth and development
                and training and, having passed the test successfully, were finally admitted to this earth and to mortality. One definite
                purpose of our spirits coming to this earth and assuming the mortal state was to obtain a physical body. This body was to
                be subject to all the weaknesses, temptations, frailties and limitations of mortality, and was to face the challenge to overcome
                self. While we lack recollection of our pre-mortal life, before coming to this earth all of us understood definitely the
                purpose of our being here. We would be expected to gain knowledge, educate ourselves, train ourselves. We were to control
                our urges and desires, master and control our passions, and overcome our weaknesses, small and large. We were to eliminate
                sins of omission and of commission, and to follow the laws and commandments given us by our Father. That the effort involved
                dignifies and ennobles man has been recognized by the world's great thinkers. Dante, for example, put it this way: "Consider
                your origin; you were not formed to live like brutes, but to follow virtue and knowledge."fn We understood also that after
                a period varying from seconds to decades of mortal life we would die, our bodies would go back to Mother Earth from which
                they had been created, and our spirits would go to the spirit world, where we would further train for our eternal destiny.
                After a period, there would be a resurrection or a reunion of the body and the spirit, which would render us immortal and
                make possible our further climb toward perfection and godhood. This resurrection has been made available to us through the
                sacrifice of the Lord Jesus Christ, the Creator of this earth, who performed this incomparable service for us-a miracle we
                could not perform for ourselves. Thus the way was opened for our immortality and-if we prove worthy-eventual exaltation in
                God's kingdom. The Gospel Our Map To pinpoint a destination not previously visited we usually consult a map. As a second
                great boon to us the Lord Jesus Christ, our Redeemer and Savior, has given us our map-a code of laws and commandments whereby
                we might attain perfection and, eventually, godhood. This set of laws and ordinances is known as the gospel of Jesus Christ,
                and it is the only plan which will exalt mankind. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is the sole repository
                of this priceless program in its fulness, which is made available to those who accept it. In order to reach the goal of eternal
                life and exaltation and godhood, one must be initiated into the kingdom by baptism, properly performed; one must receive
                the Holy Ghost by the laying on of authoritative hands; a man must be ordained to the priesthood by authorized priesthood
                holders; one must be endowed and sealed in the house of God by the prophet who holds the keys or by one of those to whom
                the keys have been delegated; and one must live a life of righteousness, cleanliness, purity and service. None can enter
                into eternal life other than by the correct door Jesus Christ and his commandments. Jesus made this very clear in these words:
                Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that entereth not by the door into the sheepfold, but climbeth up some other way, the
                same is a thief and a robber. (John 10:1.) I am the door: by me if any man enter in, he shall be saved, and shall go in and
                out, and find pasture. (John 10:9.) And Jacob, the prophet theologian, warned: O then, my beloved brethren, come unto the
                Lord, the Holy One. Remember that his paths are righteous. Behold, the way for man is narrow, but it lieth in a straight
                course before him, and the keeper of the gate is the Holy One of Israel; and he employeth no servant there; and there is
                none other way save it be by the gate; for he cannot be deceived, for the Lord God is his name. (2 Ne. 9:41.) The Straight
                Way We must not be surprised that God's requirements for eternal rewards are precise and invariable, since even man's society
                and government operates on such a basis. For instance, returning from abroad to the land of our nativity we must meet certain
                requirements and have evidence thereof in the form of passports, visas, doctors' certificates as to health and vaccinations,
                birth certificates and other documents. One cannot receive salary without having met satisfactorily the conditions of his
                employment. One cannot ride the bus, train, or plane without having paid his fare, and at the station or airport he must
                show evidence of it. One cannot become a citizen of any country without having met the requirements laid down by the laws
                of that nation. One cannot expect a degree from any college without having paid his tuition and fees, done his residence
                work, and shown proof of his having met the requirements. God's eternal rewards will similarly be dependent upon man's compliance
                with the required conditions. Prevalence of Procrastination One of the most serious human defects in all ages is procrastination,
                an unwillingness to accept personal responsibilities now. Men came to earth consciously to obtain their schooling, their
                training and development, and to perfect themselves, but many have allowed themselves to be diverted and have become merely
                "hewers of wood and drawers of water," addicts to mental and spiritual indolence and to the pursuit of worldly pleasure.
                There are even many members of the Church who are lax and careless and who continually procrastinate. They live the gospel
                casually but not devoutly. They have complied with some requirements but are not valiant. They do no major crime but merely
                fail to do the things required-things like paying tithing, living the Word of Wisdom, having family prayers, fasting, attending
                meetings, serving. Perhaps they do not consider such omissions to be sins, yet these were the kinds of things of which the
                five foolish virgins of Jesus' parable were probably guilty. The ten virgins belonged to the kingdom and had every right
                to the blessings-except that five were not valiant and were not ready when the great day came. They were unprepared through
                not living all the commandments. They were bitterly disappointed at being shut out from the marriage-as likewise their modern
                counterparts will be. One Church member of my acquaintance said, as she drank her coffee: "The Lord knows my heart is right
                and that I have good intentions, and that I will someday get the strength to quit." But will one receive eternal life on
                the basis of his good intentions? Can one enter a country, receive a scholastic degree, and so on, on the strength of good
                intent unsupported by appropriate action? Samuel Johnson remarked that "hell is paved with good intentions." The Lord will
                not translate one's good hopes and desires and intentions into works. Each of us must do that for himself. Only the Valiant
                Exalted One may be saved in any one of three kingdoms of glory-the telestial, the terrestrial, or the celestial-but one can
                reach exaltation only in the highest of the three heavens or degrees in the celestial glory. Paul told the Corinthians that:
                There are also celestial bodies, and bodies terrestrial: but the glory of the celestial is one, and the glory of the terrestrial
                is another. There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars: for one star differeth
                from another star in glory. So also is the resurrection of the dead... (1 Cor. 15:40-42.) And through the Prophet Joseph
                Smith came amplification of Paul's statement: In the celestial glory there are three heavens or degrees; And in order to
                obtain the highest, a man must enter into this order of the priesthood [meaning the new and everlasting covenant of marriage];
                And if he does not, he cannot obtain it. He may enter into the other, but that is the end of his kingdom; he cannot have
                an increase. (D&C 131:1-4.) Only the valiant will be exalted and receive the highest degree of glory, hence "many are called,
                but few are chosen." (D&C 121:40.) As the Savior put it, "... strait is the gate, and narrow the way, which leadeth unto
                life, and few there be that find it." And conversely, " ... wide is the gate, and broad is the way, that leadeth to destruction,
                and many there be which go in thereat." (Matt. 7:13, 14.) It is true that many Latter-day Saints, having been baptized and
                confirmed members of the Church, and some even having received their endowments and having been married and sealed in the
                holy temple, have felt that they were thus guaranteed the blessings of exaltation and eternal life. But this is not so. There
                are two basic requirements every soul must fulfill or he cannot attain to the great blessings offered. He must receive the
                ordinances and he must be faithful, overcoming his weaknesses. Hence, not all who claim to be Latter-day Saints will be exalted.
                But for those Latter-day Saints who are valiant, who fulfill the requirements faithfully and fully, the promises are glorious
                beyond description: Then shall they be gods, because they have no end; therefore shall they be from everlasting to everlasting,
                because they continue; then shall they be above all, because all things are subject unto them. Then shall they be gods, because
                they have all power, and the angels are subject unto them. (D&C 132:20.) Dangers of Delay Because men are prone to postpone
                action and ignore directions, the Lord has repeatedly given strict injunctions and issued solemn warnings. Again and again
                in different phraseology and throughout the centuries the Lord has reminded man so that he could never have excuse. And the
                burden of the prophetic warning has been that the time to act is now, in this mortal life. One cannot with impunity delay
                his compliance with God's commandments. Note Amulek's words, especially those forceful statements involving timing, which
                are in italics: Yea, I would that ye would come forth and harden not your hearts any longer; for behold, now is the time
                and the day of your salvation; and therefore, if ye will repent and harden not your hearts, immediately shall the great plan
                of redemption be brought about unto you. For behold, this life is the time for men to prepare to meet God; yea, behold the
                day of this life is the day for men to perform their labors. And now, as I said unto you before, as ye have had so many witnesses,
                therefore, I beseech of you that ye do not procrastinate the day of your repentance until the end; for after this day of
                life, which is given us to prepare for eternity, behold, if we do not improve our time while in this life, then cometh the
                night of darkness wherein there can be no labor performed. Ye cannot say, when ye are brought to that awful crisis, that
                I will repent, that I will return to my God. Nay, ye cannot say this; for that same spirit which doth possess your bodies
                at the time that ye go out of this life, that same spirit will have power to possess your body in that eternal world. (Al.
                34:21-34. Italics added.) Even if we leave aside the many scriptures which bear similar testimony, reading and prayerfully
                meditating upon this one brings an awe-inspiring conviction of the need to repent-now! From the modern apostle Melvin J.
                Ballard we obtain an emphasis of Amulek's expression in these terms: ...But this life is the time in which men are to repent.
                Do not let any of us imagine that we can go down to the grave not having overcome the corruptions of the flesh and then lose
                in the grave all our sins and evil tendencies. They will be with us. They will be with the spirit when separated from the
                body. This life is the time to repent. That is why I presume it will take a thousand years after the first resurrection until
                the last group will be prepared to come forth. It will take them a thousand years to do what it would have taken but three-score
                and ten to accomplish in this life.fn President Joseph F. Smith's revelation of 1918 contains these words: "... the dead
                had looked upon the long absence of their spirits from their bodies as a bondage."fn Another quotation from Elder Ballard
                amplifies President Smith's thought: ...When we go out of this life, leave this body, we will desire to do many things that
                we cannot do at all without the body. We will be seriously handicapped, and we will long for the body; we will pray for that
                early reunion with our bodies. We will know then what advantage it is to have a body. Then, every man and woman who is putting
                off until the next life the task of correcting and overcoming the weakness of the flesh are sentencing themselves to years
                of bondage, for no man or woman will come forth in the resurrection until they have completed their work, until they have
                overcome, until they have done as much as they can do.fn Eternal Marriage Now for Latter-day Saints Nowhere is the time element
                more fully stressed than in the matter of eternal marriage. It is true that a merciful Father makes special post-mortal provision
                for these who do not hear the gospel in this life, but for Latter-day Saints the time is now. Read the word of the Lord respecting
                the marriage covenant: ... I reveal unto you a new and an everlasting covenant; and if ye abide not that covenant, then are
                ye damned; for no one can reject this covenant and be permitted to enter into my glory. (D&C 132:4.) That covenant is celestial
                marriage. Relative to this subject, in our own dispensation the Lord enlarges somewhat on a statement he made to the people
                in Palestine: For strait is the gate, and narrow the way that leadeth unto the exaltation and continuation of the lives,
                and few there be that find it, because you receive me not in the world neither do ye know me. But if ye receive me in the
                world, then shall ye know me, and shall receive your exaltation; that where I am ye shall be also. This is eternal lives-to
                know the only wise and true God, and Jesus Christ, whom he hath sent. I am he. Receive ye, therefore, my law. Broad is the
                gate, and wide the way that leadeth to the deaths; and many there are that go in thereat, because they receive me not, neither
                do they abide in my law. (D&C 132:22-25. Italics added.) How impressive the Lord makes the time element! Why should he so
                emphasize it over and over if there were no significance to it? Would these phrases in the world and out of the world mean
                that one could go haphazardly through the years of mortality "eating, drinking, and being merry," ignoring all the commandments
                and failing to keep his life clean and still receive the blessings? Judgment According to Knowledge Knowledge of the gospel
                has come to many men and women in this life together with adequate opportunity to live it. Such will be judged by the gospel
                law. Should one not have had opportunities to hear and understand the gospel in this mortal life, that privilege will be
                given him hereafter. Judgment is according to knowledge and compliance. Latter-day Saints are in the first category. Having
                been blessed with the gospel privileges they are and will be judged on gospel criteria. Where the law is, it is a serious
                error not to comply with it, as the following scriptures emphasize: Jesus said unto them, If ye were blind, ye should have
                no sin: but now ye say, We see; therefore your sin remaineth. (John 9:41.) If I had not come and spoken unto them, they had
                not had sin: but now they have no cloke for their sin. (John 15:22.) And that servant, which knew his Lord's will, and prepared
                not himself, neither did according to his will, shall be beaten with many stripes. But he that knew not, and did commit things
                worthy of stripes, shall be beaten with few stripes. For unto whomsoever much is given, of him shall be much required—. (Luke
                12:47-48.) Jacob's words to his people might have been spoken directly to us: But wo unto him that has the law given, yea,
                that has all the commandments of God, like unto us, and that transgresseth them, and that wasteth the days of his probation,
                for awful is his state! (2 Ne. 9:27.) Some Opportunities End at Death Thus for us who know but do not comply, the opportunities
                for certain limitless blessings have an end when death closes our eyes. And after that you have received this, if you keep
                not my commandments you cannot be saved in the kingdom of my Father. (D&C 18:46.) King Benjamin's graphic statement is indeed
                a sobering thought: Therefore if that man repenteth not, and remaineth and dieth an enemy to God, the demands of divine justice
                do awaken his immortal soul to a lively sense of his own guilt, which doth cause him to shrink from the presence of the Lord,
                and doth fill his breast with guilt, and pain, and anguish, which is like an unquenchable fire, whose flame ascendeth up
                forever and ever. Mos. 2:38.) This is the state of those who knowingly fail to live the commandments in this life. They will
                bring upon themselves their own hell. Blessings of Repentance and Forgiveness Our loving Father has given us the blessed
                principle of repentance as the gateway to forgiveness. All sins but those excepted by the Lord-basically, the sin against
                the Holy Ghost, and murder-will be forgiven to those who totally, consistently, and continuously repent in a genuine and
                comprehensive transformation of life. There is forgiveness for even the sinner who commits serious transgressions, for the
                Church will forgive and the Lord will forgive such things when repentance has reached fruition. Repentance and forgiveness
                are part of the glorious climb toward godhood. In God's plan, man must voluntarily make this climb, for the element of free
                agency is basic. Man chooses for himself, but he cannot control the penalties. They are immutable. Little children and mental
                incompetents are not held responsible, but all others will receive either blessings, advancements, and rewards, or penalties
                and deprivation, according to their reaction to God's plan when it is presented to them and to their faithfulness to that
                plan. The Lord wisely provided for this situation and made it possible that there might be good and evil, comfort and pain.
                The alternatives give us a choice and thereby growth and development. Help from the Holy Ghost In the life of everyone there
                comes the conflict between good and evil, between Satan and the Lord. Every person who has reached or passed the age of accountability
                of eight years, and who with a totally repentant heart is baptized properly, positively will receive the Holy Ghost. If heeded,
                this member of the Godhead will guide, inspire, and warn, and will neutralize the promptings of the evil one. The Lord made
                this very clear: Therefore, as I said unto mine apostles I say unto you again, that every soul who believeth on your words,
                and is baptized by water for the remission of sins, shall receive the Holy Ghost. (D&C 84:64.) On this we have also the classic
                words of Moroni: And by the power of the Holy Ghost ye may know the truth of all things. (Moro. 10:5) Take the Uncrowded
                Path In summary, the way to eternal life is clear. It is well marked. It is difficult. Evil and good influences will be ever
                present. One must choose. Generally the evil way is the easier, and since man is carnal that way will triumph unless there
                be a conscious and a consistently vigorous effort to reject the evil and follow the good. But remember that he that persists
                in his own carnal nature, and goes on in the ways of sin and rebellion against God, remaineth in his fallen state and the
                devil hath all power over him. (Mos. 16:5.) This earth life is the time to repent. We cannot afford to take any chances of
                dying an enemy to God. Accordingly it is important that all the sons and daughters of God upon this earth may "see with their
                eyes and hear with their ears and understand with their hearts" the purpose of life and their responsibilities to themselves
                and their posterity, and that they may determine to walks the uncrowded path which is strait and which is narrow. The time
                to quit evil ways is before they start. The secret of the good life is in protection and prevention. Those who yield to evil
                are usually those who have placed themselves in a vulnerable position. Blessed and fortunate indeed are those who can resist
                evil and live all the days of their lives without yielding to temptation. But for those who have fallen, repentance is the
                way back. Repentance is always in order, even in the eleventh hour, for even that delayed action is better than none at all.
                The thief on the cross who said, "Lord, remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom" was far better off than the one who
                threw into the Lord's teeth, "If thou be the Christ, save thyself and us." (Luke 23: 39, 42.) As we have seen, one can wait
                too long to repent. Many of the Nephites did. Of these, Samuel the Lamanite said: But behold, your days of probation are
                past; ye have procrastinated the day of your salvation until it is everlastingly too late, and your destruction is made sure;
                yea, for ye have sought all the days of your lives for that which ye could not obtain; and ye have sought for happiness in
                doing iniquity, which thing is contrary to the nature of that righteousness which is in our great and Eternal Head. (Hel.
                13:38. Italics added.) Again, observe the emphasis in the words italicized. And let us not suppose that in calling people
                to repentance the prophets are concerned only with the more grievous sins such as murder, adultery, stealing, and so on,
                nor only with those persons who have not accepted the gospel ordinances. All transgressions must be cleansed, all weaknesses
                must be overcome, before a person can attain perfection and godhood. Accordingly the intent of this book is to stress the
                vital importance of each of us transforming his life through repentance and forgiveness. Future chapters will deal with the
                various aspects of this subject in greater detail. Oliver Wendell Holmes said: "Many people die with their music still in
                them. Why is this so? Too often it is because they are always getting ready to live. Before they know it, time runs out."
                Tagore expressed a similar thought in these words: "I have spent my days stringing and unstringing my instrument, while the
                song I came to sing remains unsung." My plea therefore is this: Let us get our instruments tightly strung and our melodies
                sweetly sung. Let us net die with our music still in us. Let us rather use this precious mortal probation to move confidently
                and gloriously upward toward the eternal life which God our Father gives to those who keep his commandments. Dante, Divine
                Comedy. Melvin J. Ballard, "Three Degrees of Glory." Joseph F. Smith, Gospel Doctrine (Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Co.,
                1966), p. 475. Melvin J. Ballard, "Three Degrees of Glory." Chapter Two No Unclean Thing Can Enter —All men, everywhere,
                must repent, or they can in nowise inherit the kingdom of God, for no unclean thing can dwell there, or dwell in his presence—
                —Moses 6:57 AS WE DISCUSSED IN CHAPTER 1, THE ROAD OF LIFE is plainly marked according to the divine purpose, the map of
                the gospel of Jesus Christ is made available to the travelers, the destination of eternal life is clearly established. At
                that destination our Father waits hopefully, anxious to greet his returning children. Unfortunately many will not arrive.
                The reason is forthrightly stated by Nephi-"... There cannot any unclean thing enter into the Kingdom of God ..." (1 Ne.
                15:34.) And again, "... no unclean thing can dwell with God..." (1 Ne. 10:21.) To the prophets the term unclean in this context
                means what it means to God. To man the word may be relative in meaning-one minute specks of dirt does not make a white shirt
                or dress unclean, for example. But to God who is perfection, cleanliness means moral and personal cleanliness. Less than
                that is, in one degree or another, uncleanliness and hence cannot dwell with God. Were it not for the blessed gifts of repentance
                and forgiveness this would be a hopeless situation for man, since no one except the Master has ever lived sinless on the
                earth. Naturally, there are all degrees of sin. At worst, the deep sinner is in the thrall of Satan. As Jesus put it, his
                "whole body [is] full of darkness." The Savior went on to express the impossibility of serving God, of being close to him,
                under these circumstances: No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he
                will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon. (Matt. 6:24.) We Belong Where We Serve Sin,
                then, is service to Satan. It is a truism that men are "his whom they list to obey." Many scriptures affirm this statement.
                Jesus pointed to this truth when he said to the Jews, "Whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin." (John 8:34.) Paul,
                writing to the Romans, said: Neither yield ye your members as instruments of unrighteousness unto sin: but yield yourselves
                unto God, as those that are alive from the dead, and your members as instruments of righteousness unto God. For sin shall
                not have dominion over you. Know ye not, that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants ye are to whom ye
                obey; whether of sin unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness? (Rom. 6:13, 15-16.) Peter too emphasizes this bondage:
                For when they speak great swelling words of vanity, they allure through the lusts of the flesh, through much wantonness,
                those that were clean escaped from them who live in error. While they promise them liberty, they themselves are the servants
                of corruption: for of whom a man is overcome, of the same is he brought in bondage. (2 Pet. 2:18-19.) It might be observed
                that the term lust is not necessarily limited in its connotation to sexual desire. It can imply any fleshly or worldly appetite
                or urge carried to excess. Satan will eagerly use other urges which suit his purpose, as well as sexual ones, in an effort
                to enslave men until, as Mormon put it: They are led about by Satan, even as chaff is driven before the wind, or as a vessel
                is tossed about upon the waves, without sail or anchor, or without anything wherewith to steer her; and even as she is, so
                are they. (Morm. 5:18.) Reality of Satan In these days of sophistication and error men depersonalize not only God but the
                devil. Under this concept Satan is a myth, useful for keeping people straight in less enlightened days but outmoded in our
                educated age. Nothing is further from reality. Satan is very much a personal, individual spirit being, but without a mortal
                body. His desires to seal each of us his are no less ardent in wickedness than our Father's are in righteousness to attract
                us to his own eternal kingdom. A glimpse of Satan's tactics, as well as a terrifyingly accurate character sketch, is given
                us by Nephi in this prophecy respecting our own day: For behold, at that day shall he rage in the hearts of the children
                of men, and stir them up to anger against that which is good. And others will he pacify, and lull them away into carnal security,
                that they will say: All is well in Zion; yea, Zion prospereth, all is well-and thus the devil cheateth their souls, and leadeth
                them away carefully down to hell. And behold, others he flattereth away, and telleth them there is no hell; and he saith
                unto them: [ am no devil, for there is none-and thus he whispereth in their ears, until he grasps them with his awful chains,
                from whence there is no deliverance. Yea, they are grasped with death, and hell; and death, and hell, and the devil, and
                all that have been seized therewith must stand before the throne of God, and be judged according to their works, from whence
                they must go into the place prepared for them—. (2 Ne. 28:20-23.) Yes, the devil is decidedly a person. He is also clever
                and trained. With thousands of years of experience behind him he has become superbly efficient and increasingly determined.
                Young people often feel and say, when governing hands are outstretched to them, "I can take care of myself." In fact even
                more experienced adults cannot afford to be sure of their resistance to Satan. Teenage girls or boys certainly need to be
                properly fortified and protected if they are to cope with the efficient, highly-trained, superior powers which are ever alert
                to opportunities for temptation. It is a smart person, young or old, who will accept advice and counsel from experienced
                people who know the pitfalls, the crumbling walls, and the cracking dams which bring on destruction. Old Sins, New Names
                Sins may be classified in many categories. They range from the simple improprieties and indiscretions to the shedding of
                innocent blood and the sin against the Holy Ghost. There are sins against ourselves, sins against our loved ones, sins against
                our fellowmen, sins against our communities, sins against the Church, sins against humanity. There are sins which are known
                to the world and others which are so carefully hidden that the sinner is the only mortal being who knows of the error. Sometimes
                a new generation gives old sins new names-often designations which remove any implication of sin-and as one reads the long
                scriptural list of transgressions he does not recognize them by their modern names. But they are all there in the scriptures,
                and are all here and practiced in our own day. Sometimes a person, not discovering in the scriptures the modern name for
                the particular sin or perversion of which he is guilty, eases his conscience by trying to convince himself that, after all,
                it is not too bad because it is not specifically prohibited. For instance, the word petting may never be found in the scriptures
                but the act of petting is repeatedly condemned. Likewise other sins and perversions may not be named in the scriptures by
                their modern appellations, but a careful scrutiny of the scriptures will reveal that all these things were done to their
                shame by the Romans and the Corinthians and the Ephesians and the children of Israel and other peoples throughout the ages.
                Then again, in interviewing young people and sometimes older ones, I find that many do not know the meaning of the names
                of the sins in the old scriptures. One young man said, "I know what adultery is, but what is this fornication and is it wrong?"
                A prominent social worker said that there were many young people who had grown to maturity physically yet had never been
                told in plain terms that sexual relations outside of marriage were deep sins. Accordingly, though it is an unpleasant discussion,
                this book will discuss such subjects in subsequent chapters. Scriptural List of Sins Since the scriptural catalog is so complete,
                particularly in the writings of the early-day apostles, let us list the sins the scriptures describe. For example, Paul's
                prophecy to Timothy about the conditions of our own day has been fulfilled with depressing precision. This know also, that
                in the last days perilous times shall come. For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers,
                disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, Without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce,
                despisers of those that are good, Traitors, heady, highminded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God; Having a form
                of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from such turn away. For of this sort are they which creep into houses, and
                lead captive silly women laden with sins, led away with divers lusts. (2 Tim. 3:1-6.) Paul warned the Romans of similar sins:
                ... Uncleanness through the lusts of their own hearts, to dishonour their own bodies between themselves: Who ... worshipped
                and served the creature more than the Creator... ... God gave them up unto vile affections: for even their women did change
                the natural use into that which is against nature: And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned
                in their lust one toward another; men with men working that which is unseemly. Backbiters, haters of God, despiteful, proud,
                boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents. ... Covenantbreakers, without natural affection, implacable,
                unmerciful: Who knowing the judgment of God, that they which commit such things are worthy of death, not only do the same,
                but have pleasure in them that do them. (Rom. 1:24-27, 30- 32.) A few more types of sin are mentioned in Paul's words to
                the Corinthians: ... Neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind,
                Nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God. (1 Cor. 6:9-10.)
                John the Revelator catalogues the transgressions which will merit the second death: But the fearful, and unbelieving, and
                the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the
                lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death. (Rev. 21:8.) Sexual sin receives repeated condemnation
                in the scriptures. To get our definitions clear, let us realize that heterosexual intercourse is the sin of fornication when
                committed by the unmarried and is adultery when indulged in by married people outside of their marriage covenants. Both are
                grievous sins in God's sight. Wrote Paul: Know ye not that your bodies are the members of Christ? shall I then take the members
                of Christ, and make them members of an harlot? God forbid. What? know ye not that he which is joined to an harlot is one
                body? for two, saith he, shall be one flesh. Flee fornication. (1 Cor. 6:15-16, 18.) In other epistles Paul makes additional
                emphasis and lists further sins. (See Rom. 1:24-32; 1 Cor. 3:16-17; 6:9-10; 10:8; Eph. 5:3-7; Gal. 5:19-21; Col. 3:5, 7-8;
                1 Thess. 4:3-5.) As we read the scriptures quoted or referred to above, we observe that they list virtually all the modern
                transgressions, though sometimes under ancient names. Let us review the lengthy list: Murder, adultery, theft, cursing, unholiness
                in masters, disobedience in servants, unfaithfulness, improvidence, hatred of God, disobedience to husbands, lack of natural
                affection, high-mindedness, flattery, lustfulness, infidelity, indiscretion, backbiting, whispering, lack of truth, striking,
                brawling, quarrelsomeness, unthankfulness, inhospitality, deceitfulness, irreverence, boasting, arrogance, pride, double-tongued
                talk, profanity, slander, corruptness, thievery, embezzlement, despoiling, covenant-breaking, incontinence, filthiness, ignobleness,
                filthy communications, impurity, foolishness, slothfulness, impatience, lack of understanding, unmercifulness, idolatry,
                blasphemy, denial of the Holy Ghost, Sabbath breaking, envy, jealousy, malice, maligning, vengefulness, implacability, bitterness,
                clamor, spite, defiling, reviling, evil speaking, provoking, greediness for filthy lucre, disobedience to parents, anger,
                hate, covetousness, bearing false witness, inventing evil things, fleshliness, heresy, presumptuousness, abomination, insatiable
                appetite, instability, ignorance, self-will, speaking evil of dignitaries, becoming a stumbling block; and in our modern
                language, masturbation, petting, fornication, adultery, homosexuality; and every sex perversion, every hidden and secret
                sin and all unholy and impure practices. These are transgressions the Lord has condemned through his servants. Let no one
                rationalize his sins on the excuse that a particular sin of his is not mentioned nor forbidden in scripture. Purity Essential
                to Eternal Life Whoever else suffers, every sin is against God, for it tends to frustrate the program and purposes of the
                Almighty. Likewise, every sin is committed against the sinner, for it limits his progress and curtails his development. In
                our journey toward eternal life, purity must be our constant aim. To walk and talk with God, to serve with God, to follow
                his example and become as a god, we must attain perfection. In his presence there can be no guile, no wickedness, no transgression.
                In numerous scriptures he has made it clear that all worldliness, evil and weakness must be dropped before we can ascend
                unto "the hill of the Lord." The Psalmist asked: Who shall ascend into the hill of the Lord? or who shall stand in his holy
                place? And he answered the question: He that hath clean hands, and a pure heart; who hath not lifted up his soul unto vanity,
                nor sworn deceitfully. (Ps. 24:3-4.) Writing of his vision of the celestial city, John said: And there shall in no wise enter
                into it any thing that defileth, neither whatsoever worketh abomination, or maketh a lie: but they which are written in the
                Lamb's book of life. (Rev. 21:27.) After enumerating many sins, Paul told the Galatians: ... As I have also told you in time
                past, that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God. (Gal. 5:21.) From the beginning God has left no
                doubt in the minds of his people that only the clean and pure will inherit his kingdom. To Adam he gave the commandment:
                Wherefore teach it unto your children, that all men, everywhere, must repent, or they can in nowise inherit the kingdom of
                God, for no unclean thing can dwell there, or dwell in his presence... (Moses 6:57.) Numerous scriptures attest to the same
                principle that only the pure can dwell with God. (For example, see Mos. 2:37; Al. 21:37; Titus 1:15-16.) It can be no other
                way, for "... to be carnally-minded is death, and to be spiritually-minded is life eternal." (2 Ne. 9:39.) Jesus himself
                expressed the thought superbly in the Beatitudes-"Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God." (Matt. 5:8.) Purity
                of heart means perfection; and the perfect will not only see God but will have friendship with him. This concept that sin
                estranges one from God, and if not repented of will keep us from his presence, is not confined to the ancient prophets. The
                modern Prophet Joseph Smith similarly saw sin as a major obstacle to salvation and godhood. He said on one occasion: ...
                If you wish to go where God is, you must be like God, or possess the principles which God possesses, for if we are not drawing
                towards God in principle, we are going from him and drawing towards the devil. Yes, I am standing in the midst of all kinds
                of people. Search your hearts, and see if you are like God. I have searched mine, and feel to repent of all my sins. We have
                thieves among us, adulterers, liars, hypocrites. If God should speak from heaven, he would command you not to steal, not
                to commit adultery, not to covet, nor deceive, but be faithful over a few things. As far as we degenerate from God, we descend
                to the devil and lose knowledge, and without knowledge we cannot be saved, and while our hearts are filled with evil, and
                we are studying evil, there is no room in our hearts for good, or studying good—fn Need Is Discipline When I was a young
                boy I took care of a Jersey bull which became vicious and charged me several times. All I needed to do to halt his attack
                was to jerk the chain attached to the ring in his nose and he became docile and manageable. As he became less tractable,
                I added a long bamboo pole fastened to the ring in his nose. I now had him totally under subjection, for I could hold him
                back or lead him forward. He was under my control. So does sin, as a ring in the nose, have the sinner under subjection.
                So is sin like handcuffs on the wrists, a ring in the nose, and slave bands around the neck. But to carry the analogy further,
                my bull, had he been human, might have disciplined himself. Then with no ring in the nose he would have controlled his own
                actions. So it is with human sin-self-control, self-mastery, can be substituted for the dominion of sin, and the sinner can
                move by his own agency toward God rather than under the control of sin toward Satan.
