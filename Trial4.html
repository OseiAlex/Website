        <p>
        <br>When all but I is sought
        <br>I have made my peace
        <br>And it matters not that at your peace
        <br>How tranquil, how tummit
        <br>None I can tell
        <br>For all is gone a-sail
        <br>And I to I can see
        <br>You and you none
        <br>So don't wait for me
        <br>For i will be at sail 
        </p>
